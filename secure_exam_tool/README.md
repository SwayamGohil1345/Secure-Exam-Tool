<!-- "I want to implement a secure functionality in my remote proctoring-based exam tool where, once a user submits the exam, the system should automatically check their total score. If the user has scored greater than or equal to 70%, then I (the admin) should receive a mobile phone notification containing the user's login details (like name, email, phone, or any data they filled during login). This feature must be fully secure, should not disturb or alter any existing functionality, and must operate only when the exam is submitted and the criteria is met."

   - Answer questions using the provided interface

3. **Warnings and Violations**
   - You'll receive warnings for violations
   - Multiple violations may result in session termination
   - Tab switching: 5 warnings maximum
   - Gaze violations: 10 warnings maximum

### For Administrators

1. **Monitor Sessions**
   - View active sessions in real-time
   - Check violation logs
   - Monitor student activity

2. **Configure Settings**
   - Adjust warning limits
   - Set session timeouts
   - Configure camera settings

## Configuration

### Warning Limits
You can modify the warning limits in `app.py`:

```python
MAX_TAB_SWITCH_WARNINGS = 5    # Maximum tab switch warnings
MAX_GAZE_WARNINGS = 10         # Maximum gaze violation warnings
```

### Camera Settings
Adjust camera resolution and quality in `templates/exam_room.html`:

```javascript
const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ 
    video: { 
        width: 640, 
        height: 480,
        facingMode: 'user'
    } 
});
```

## Technical Details

### Backend (Python/Flask)
- **Flask**: Web framework for the application
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time communication
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision for face detection
- **MediaPipe**: Advanced face mesh and gaze tracking
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations

### Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- **Bootstrap**: UI framework for responsive design
- **Socket.IO Client**: Real-time communication
- **MediaDevices API**: Camera access
- **Canvas API**: Image processing

### Security Features

- **Face Detection**: Real-time face presence monitoring
- **Session Management**: Automatic violation tracking and termination

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Camera not working**
   - Ensure camera permissions are granted
   - Check if camera is being used by another application
   - Try refreshing the page

2. **Face detection not working**
   - Ensure good lighting
   - Position yourself clearly in front of camera
   - Check camera resolution settings

3. **Tab switching detection too sensitive**
   - Adjust the debounce timing in the JavaScript code
   - Modify warning thresholds

4. **Performance issues**
   - Reduce camera resolution
   - Close other applications
   - Check system resources

### Browser Compatibility
- **Chrome**: Full support (recommended)
- **Firefox**: Full support
- **Safari**: Limited support
- **Edge**: Full support

## Development

### Adding New Features

1. **New Proctoring Rules**
   - Add detection logic in `proctor_utils.py`
   - Update frontend JavaScript
   - Modify warning system

2. **Custom Exam Interface**
   - Modify `templates/exam_room.html`
   - Add custom CSS in `static/css/styles.css`
   - Update JavaScript functionality

3. **Backend Extensions**
   - Add new routes in `app.py`
   - Extend `ProctorSession` class
   - Implement new Socket.IO events

### Testing

1. **Local Testing**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   # Open multiple browser tabs to test tab switching
   # Move away from camera to test gaze tracking
   ```

2. **Production Deployment**
   - Use a production WSGI server (Gunicorn)
   - Set up proper SSL certificates
   - Configure firewall rules
   - Use a reverse proxy (Nginx)

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- Camera data is processed locally
- No video recordings are stored
- Session logs contain only metadata
- All data is encrypted in transit

### Access Control
- Implement proper authentication
- Use HTTPS in production
- Regular security updates
- Monitor for suspicious activity
